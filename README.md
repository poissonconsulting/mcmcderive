## Why `mcmcderive`?

`mcmcderive` is an R package to generate derived parameter(s) from Monte
Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) samples using R code.

This is useful because it means Bayesian models can be fitted without
the inclusion of derived parameters which add unnecessary clutter and
slows model fitting. For more information on MCMC samples see Brooks et
al.Â (2011).

## Installation

To install the latest release version from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mcmcderive)

    install.packages("mcmcderive")

To install the latest development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/mcmcderive)

    remotes::install_github("poissonconsulting/mcmcderive")

## Demonstration

``` r
library(mcmcderive)

mcmcr::mcmcr_example
#> $alpha
#> [1] 3.718025 4.718025
#> 
#> nchains:  2 
#> niters:  400 
#> 
#> $beta
#>           [,1]     [,2]
#> [1,] 0.9716535 1.971654
#> [2,] 1.9716535 2.971654
#> 
#> nchains:  2 
#> niters:  400 
#> 
#> $sigma
#> [1] 0.7911975
#> 
#> nchains:  2 
#> niters:  400

expr <- "
  log(alpha2) <- alpha
  gamma <- sum(alpha) * sigma
"

mcmc_derive(mcmcr::mcmcr_example, expr, silent = TRUE)
#> $alpha2
#> [1]  41.18352 111.94841
#> 
#> nchains:  2 
#> niters:  400 
#> 
#> $gamma
#> [1] 6.60742
#> 
#> nchains:  2 
#> niters:  400
```

### Parallel Chains

If the MCMC object has multiple chains the run time can be substantially
reduced by generating the derived parameters for each chain in parallel.
In order for this to work it is necessary to:

1)  Ensure plyr and doParallel are installed using
    `install.packages(c("plyr", "doParallel"))`.
2)  Register a parallel backend using
    `doParallel::registerDoParallel(4)`.
3)  Set `parallel = TRUE` in the call to `mcmc_derive()`.

### Extras

To facilitate the translation of model code into R code the `extras`
package provides the R equivalent to common model functions such as
`pow()`, `phi()` and `log() <-`.
