# mcmcderive

## Introduction

`mcmcderive` is an R package to generate derived parameters from Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) samples.
No more rerunning a model because you forget to include a derived parameter!

The `mcmcderive` package also provides the R equivalent to functions such as `pow()`, `logit() <- `
that often occur in JAGS/BUGS, STAN, ADMB/TMB model code.
This allows you to mimic template code in your R expression.


## Demonstration

```{r}
library(mcmcderive)

mcmcr_example <- mcmcr::mcmcr_example
mcmcr_example

gamma <- mcmc_derive(mcmcr_example, "gamma <- sum(alpha) * sigma")
gamma
```
