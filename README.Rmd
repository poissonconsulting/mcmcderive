## Why `mcmcderive`?

`mcmcderive` is an R package to generate derived parameter(s) from Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) samples using R code.

This is useful because it means Bayesian models can be fitted without the inclusion of derived parameters which add unnecessary clutter and slows model fitting.
For more information on MCMC samples see Brooks et al. (2011).

## Demonstration

```{r}
library(mcmcderive)

mcmcr::mcmcr_example

expr <- "
  log(alpha2) <- alpha
  gamma <- sum(alpha) * sigma
"

mcmc_derive(mcmcr::mcmcr_example, expr, silent = TRUE)
```

### Parallel Chains

If the MCMC object has multiple chains the run time can be substantially reduced by generating the derived parameters for each chain in parallel.
In order for this to work it is necessary to:

1) Ensure plyr and doParallel are installed using `install.packages(c("plyr", "doParallel"))`.
2) Register a parallel backend using `doParallel::registerDoParallel(4)`.
3) Set `parallel = TRUE` in the call to `mcmc_derive()`.

### Extras

To facilitate the translation of model code into R code the `extras` package provides the R equivalent to common model functions such as `pow()`, `phi()` and `log() <- `.
